# Blocks of different languages

Simple way of creating blocks of different languages in the same page, without the switch button.
I used "i18n" and "VueJs", "boostrap Vue" to achieve this. I am learning Vue.Js and having a lots of fun ðŸ˜œ
If you want to add other languages feel free to add the translated info in the "\src\langs\language.vue"
This is probably not the best way of doing it but it may help you to achieve your goal


### Have fun !!
